# Dialog Craft

## About

Dialog Craft is a desktop application for visual creation and editing of dialog systems, designed for game designers. The application provides a convenient way to build complex dialog trees with automatic node arrangement according to hierarchy.

This project was created to help a friend with game development and to gain experience in "vibe coding" - a collaborative approach with AI assistance. Not a single line of code was written independently by the human developer - even this README file was rephrased and translated with the help of AI.

## AI Collaboration

The development process involved various AI models:

- GPT-4o
- Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking (experimental)
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet (which contributed the majority of the code)

## Project Overview

Dialog Craft is built using:

- Electron for cross-platform desktop functionality
- React for UI components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Cytoscape.js and Dagre for visualizing and arranging dialog graphs

The application allows game designers to:

- Create and edit dialog cards with various attributes
- Establish connections between cards to form dialog trees
- Automatically arrange cards in a hierarchy
- Import and export dialogs in YAML format
- Auto-save progress to prevent data loss
